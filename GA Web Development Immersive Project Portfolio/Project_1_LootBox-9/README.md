This game is a league of legends themed slot machine.

Filled with fun and bright colors its objective is to allow the player to test their odds and see how long they can last.





Each click costs 5 health, and depending on what type of match you end up with you can earn back 5, 20, 30 or even 100 health points back.

## Next Steps

I would like to add a visually responsive health bar, something like you would see in a video game.  I would also like to add a visual indicator that you have rolled a match. This indicator will have two parts, first the icons shaking, second displaying the points earned as it is added to the top of the screen.
