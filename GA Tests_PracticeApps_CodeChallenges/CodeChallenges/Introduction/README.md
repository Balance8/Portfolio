Introduction
Welcome to WDI! Below are four basic JavaScript problems. Go ahead and do them to the best of your ability! Don't worry if you can't get them, we just want to see where you're at.

Write an add Function
Write a function called add that takes two numbers, adds them together and returns their sum. Below are some examples of how add can be used.

```
add(1,2) //=> 3
add(0,5) //=> 5
```

Create a Variable
Create a variable named cat and assign to the string "cute".

Compute arrayLength
Write a function called arrayLength that accepts an array as its only parameter and returns the length of the array. Below are some examples of how arrayLength can be used.

```
arrayLength([5,13,9]) //=> 3
arrayLength([]) //=> 0
```

Write keys
Write a function called keys that accepts an object as its only parameters and returns an array of the keys of this object. Below is an example of how keys can be used.

```
keys({ a: "cat", b: "dog" }) //=> ["a", "b"]
```
