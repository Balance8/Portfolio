During my tenure at General Assembly, I completed four assessments as well as over 60 code challenges. These assessments served to showcase my skill sets and understanding of JavaScript, Ruby/Rails, Node/Express, and React.js. As well as practical application of Computer Science methodologies to real-world problems.
The readme files serve as a primer to understanding the code and approach taken.  All solutions can be found in the corresponding project's "SolutionCode" folder - labeled as that project's name.
